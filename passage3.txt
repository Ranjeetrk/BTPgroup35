Monrovia was named after James Monroe, who was president of the United States in 1822.
In that year a group of freed U.S. slaves, sponsored by a U.S. society, started a new settlement
on the continent of their ancestors. As more settlers arrived from the United States and from
the Caribbean area, the area they controlled grew larger. In 1847 Monrovia became the capital
of the new country of Liberia
